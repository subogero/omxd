===================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

 service omxd start|stop|restart
 omxd [OPTIONS]

 echo <command> [abs-path] > /var/run/omxctl
 omxd <command> [rel-path]

## DESCRIPTION

The omxd daemon plays your playlist even if you've disconnected from your
Raspberry Pi, to allow the easy implementation of various media centre apps.
After install, omxd is started automatically at boot.

 -n	No fork, run in foreground, log to stderr (fg=1)
 -g	Gap mode, do not prepare next track (gap=1)

## COMMANDS

omxd listens for commands through the /var/run/omxctl FIFO,
please write one command at a time into it, for example:

echo A /home/foo/bar.mp3 > /var/run/omxctl

## CLIENT MODE

You can call omxd with the above commands as arguments, it writes them
into /var/run/omxctl, but translates relative paths into absolute ones
and performs commands recursively if you specify a directory as the file.

## FILES

When you start 'omxd -d' as an unprivileged user the files below
will be created in the current directory instead of the locations below,
to allow easier testing.

     /var/run/omxctl	FIFO to write commands into
     /var/local/omxplay	playlist file, actual item indicated by >
     /var/log/omxlog	log file
     /var/log/omxstat	status log file
     /var/log/omxplayer.log.<pid>
     /etc/omxd.conf	configuration, see options above
     /etc/init.d/omxd	init script
