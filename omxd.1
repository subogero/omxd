You can call omxd with the above commands as arguments, it writes them
into /var/run/omxctl, but translates relative paths into absolute ones
and performs commands recursively if you specify a directory as the file\.
.
.SH "FILES"
When you start the omxd daemon as an unprivileged user the files below
will be created in the current directory instead of the locations below,
to allow easier testing\.
